This week, more improvements to `Limit.doit` were made.

`floor` and `ceiling` were not handled by the leading term block due to bugs in
their functions. These bugs were mainly related to improper direction handling.
These were fixed and hence there is no longer a need to enter the `Gruntz` limit
calculations.

After these changes, many heuristics being used in Limit.doit before the call to
`gruntz` were removed.

There was also a bug in `besselj._eval_as_leading_term` - a factor of `gamma(nu + 1)`
was missing. This factor was added, and hence [sympy/sympy#21701](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/21701) was fixed.

`sin` and `cos` leading term methods no longer return the function itself at
real infinites, instead they return `AccumBounds(-1, 1)`. `Ei`, `Ci`, `Shi`, `Chi`
leading term methods were added.

`sinh` and `cosh` leading term methods were also improved, to remove the call of
contains and handle more cases.

A PR was opened with all these changes - [#21731](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/21731). Next week would be
dedicated to firstly addressing the review comments of this PR, and then proceeding
to add more special function leading term methods.

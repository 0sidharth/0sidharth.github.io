This week was focused on fixing underlying errors in low-level leading term
methods, which were popping up while making amendments to the limits code.

I encountered 3 non-terminating limits and several other wrong answers. After
some discussion with my mentors, it was decided that the `_eval_as_leading_term`
methods should have a `logx` parameter. I added these to all methods.

Apart from this, `log._eval_as_leading_term` method should raise when the
argument is a singularity (0 or complex infinity) of log, and this was added.
Previously, it would just return `log(arg)` (the original expression whose
leading term we were trying to find).

There were a few other miscellaneous issues with other functions, which can be
found on my PR. Currently, 4 test failures remain, so this work should finish
up within 1-2 days, after which only review changes would be required. I plan
on tackling the issue of where to call `aseries` in the `series` code.

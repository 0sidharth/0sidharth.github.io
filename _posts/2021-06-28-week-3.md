This week was focused on changing the behaviour of Pow and exp leading term
methods to raise `PoleError` when the argument of the function is unbounded.

Previously, they returned the original function itself for compatibility reasons,
however, this isn't accurate as no power series expansion exists. By the docstring
of `leadterm`, it returns (c, e) where `c*x**e` is the first term of the power
series expansion.

This change caused much of the limit and series code to break, and required
addition of try-except statements to handle the exception.

Along with these two functions, `factorial` and `gamma` also saw similar changes.
With this, PR#21589 is ready for review.

Next week will be focused on addressing the review comments and then proceeding
to add `_eval_nseries` and `_eval_as_leading_term` methods for other special
functions.
